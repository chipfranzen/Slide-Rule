    "## The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year hundreds of thousands of applications are filed for work visas in the US. So many, in fact, that legistated caps on the number of H-1B applications have been reached every single year since 2007. In 2008, the quota was reached on the first day of open applications. In light of this, companies and potential employees that are lucky enough to get their application in via the lottery want to ensure that they have as high a chance as possible of having their application approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates application data sets and create models that predict the risk of rejection of a new application. These models can evaluate the strength of an application before it is submitted, and provide insights into how a weak application can be improved. The models also elucidate the most important factors determining the fate of a visa application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are published by the US Dapartment of Labor. The data sets are comprised of quarterly application data and decisions for different types of visas in 2015. The data (72 MB) is found at:\n",
    "\n",
    "        http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/docs/py2015q4/PERM_Disclosure_Data_FY15_Q4.xlsx\n",
    "        \n",
    "With the record layout at:\n",
    "\n",
    "        http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/docs/py2015q4/PERM_FY15_Record_Layout.doc\n",
    "\n",
    "The data fields cover a wide range of information, including details about the country of origin of the applicant, location and type of the job, pay and educational requirements of the job, education of the applicant, and whether all regulatory hurdles have been cleared.\n",
    "\n",
    "H-1B visas are work visas that are only for 'specialty applications', and therefore can act as a bellweather for how much highly-educated talent the US is importing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "I have treated this as a supervised learning classification problem. The binary variable 'denied' indicates whether an application was rejected.\n",
    "\n",

    "matplotlib for:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        data visualization\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Data Wrangling and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The data come in the form of MS Excel spreadsheets, which are easily loaded into pandas dataframes. All the data are formatted as unicode strings, some of which pandas handles automatically. For example, the submission dates are automatically read as pandas date-time objects. Some strings require a little more work to prepare them for the classifiers. Yes/No fields are converted in to binary integers, and commas are removed from numerical data before converting them to floats. To deal with categorical data, dummy variables are created for each category using a patsy formula. NaNs are handled by filling in a 0, since I prefer that a feature is underweighted due to extra zeros, rather than overweighted due to extra ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection and Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data set is large, I've included as many features as possible, since I do not want to rely on intuition or fuzzy logic to build the model. Including as much information as possible increases the chances of unveiling a new or surprising insight. To capture seasonal variations, the month of each application submission was extracted and treated as a categorical variable. In order to gauge the effect of higher or lower than normal salary offers, A feature was created to identify offers with a significantly higher or lower salary than the prevailing wage for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Models were fit using GridSearchCV, which searches through a grid of parameters for each model, returning the model that gives the highest k-fold cross validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression (Logit)\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is usefull in that it returns coefficients for each feature, which might be positive or negative, giving an indication of whether a particular feature is weakening or strengthening an application. This is in contrast to decision tree-based models, which only report 'feature importance'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn does not provide a method for adjusting the threshold probability for classification (default is .5), so this had to be adjusted manually. This was repeated for all other classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Tree Classification (DTC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is formatted for Logistic Regression, it is easy to fit a decision tree and, indeed, all the other classifiers. Decision Trees are somewhat computationaly expensive, so the number of parameter combinations that can be tested is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Forest  (RF)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensemble method pairs well with Decisions Trees, as it creates random trees and evaluates them. This is a good way to check many different trees, as opposed to DTC. As it creates and compares 10 different trees every time it's called, RF gets very expensive, so cross-validation was limited to 5-fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensemble method creates a strong learner out of many weak learners (trees in this case). It begins with a base model, then iteratively adjusts it, stepping down the cost-function gradient. A modification of the model fits the base tree to a random sample of the training set. This is called Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and was identified by grid search as a more accurate model. Gradient Boosting is also very expensive, so parameter optimization was limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Voting Classifier (Vote)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to summarize the combined wisdom of the different models, a voting classifier is used, identifying the riskiest applications by consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy does not turn out to be a very useful way of evaluating the models. Instead, precision and recall are much more important. The goal is to find a model that flags at least half of all rejected applications, and for the flagged applications to be at as high a risk as possible of being rejected. This way, if an application is flagged, it will be know that it at much higher than average risk of being rejected, and a decision can be made accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the evaluation, I used confusion matrices to analyze precision and recall for each model. I also tuned the probability at which an application was flagged risky, using binary search in most cases, and linear search in the one case (DCT) where this did not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also did a final k-fold cross-validation to ensure that there were not wild variations in accuracy across different data samples, which might indicate overfitting to training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected models were very effective in searching out risky applications. The null hypothesis is for this problem is the risk that an application will be rejected if no applications are flagged as risky, which is about 7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ H_{null}=.067$\n",
    "\n",
    "For every model, flagged applications were at a much greater risk of rejection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Model        Risk\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Logit        .18\n",
    "    DTC          .34\n",
    "    RF           .31\n",
    "    GBC          .23\n",
    "    Vote         .24\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the coefficients and feature importances are listed below, but the primary trend is that highly-paid specialists are at the lowest risk of being rejected. Positions requiring little or no education, or with low wages and, especially, wages below the prevailing wage for the industry are rejected at high rates. Applications prepared in house by the sponsoring company are also at an advantage. H-1B visas are rejected at a lower rate than other visa types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A less prominent narrative concerns the opportunity to exploit foreign workers: jobs that require the worker to live at the work site and live in domestic workers are rejected at a higher-than-normal rate. In jobs like these, the worker is at considerable risk of exploitation at the hands of their employer, so this may be a measure to prevent human trafficking or labor abuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are geographical and seasonal patterns. Indians have a low rate of rejection, and Mexicans a high one, and March is the best month to turn in a application, but these variables are of dubious causal significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the base rate of application rejection is so low (6.7% for all visa types), it is difficult to suss out relevant variables. The models tended to have a high number of false-negatives (type II errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The models also end up provinding some unhelpful insights. For example, country of citizenship is a strong factor in application acceptance. It won't be helpful to most applicants to tell them to change their citizenship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further Research\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the important features can be examined for further correlations/patterns. Some features seem likely candidates for dimensionality reduction through PCA, like the three wage features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk assessment for specific visa types could be carried out using these same techniques. H-1B is the likely candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project could be wrapped in a web application and tested on real world data, asking visa applicants to input their info and report back their results, which could be compared to the model's prediction. When new quarterly data are published, the model's predictive capabilities can be tested in earnest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This projects also acts as a proof-of-concept for application analysis. It could easily be applied to other types of applications for which large data sets exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Client Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the risk of a costly rejection, companies should screen foreign applicants and choose the best qualified, with the lowest chances of rejection. Screened applicants should then have their applications prepared either in house or by an immigration professional (most likely a lawyer).\n",
    "\n",
    "If all available candidates are risky, the company should look at the application features that are most significantly increasing risk and alter the application and their job offer to reduce risk. Common recommendations will be to apply for H-1B visas and increase the wage being offered. "

Another new insight from the tree model is that having the employer complete the application is a significant factor. Other than that, the important features match well with those identified by logistic regression.
