    "## The Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year hundreds of thousands of applications are filed for work visas in the US. So many, in fact, that legistated caps on the number of H-1B applications have been reached every single year since 2007. In 2008, the quota was reached on the first day of open applications. In light of this, companies and potential employees that are lucky enough to get their application in via the lottery want to ensure that they have as high a chance as possible of having their application approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "My project is to investigate application data sets and create models that will predict the acceptance or rejection of a given application. This model could evaluate the strength of an application before it is submitted, and provide insights into how a weak application could be improved. The model will also elucidate the most important factors determining the fate of a visa application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be investigating data published by the US Dapartment of Labor. The data sets are comprised of quarterly application data and decisions for different types of visas. I will be focusing on two of these data sets: one that includes a mix of all visa types, and one that is comprised solely of H-1B visas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data fields cover a wide range of information, including details about the country of origin of the applicant, location and type of the job, pay and educational requirements of the job, education of the applicant, and whether all regulatory hurdles have been cleared.\n",
    "\n",
    "H-1B visas are work visas that are only for 'specialty applications', and therefore can act as a bellweather for how much highly-educated talent the US is importing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be treating this as a classification problem. The binary variable 'denied' will indicate whether an application was rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far I have used logistic regression to model the all-visa dataset. Next steps include refining the logistic regression model, creating a similar model for the H-1B data set, and continuing with other machine learning techniques, including Tree-based Models and SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement logistic regression, I've had to format the data sets, converting string cell values into integers or floats, and creating dummy variables for categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using backdata from the Department of Labor, I will test my models and further refine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the base rate of application rejection is so low (6.7% for all visa types), it may be difficult to suss out relevant variables. Thus far my models have tended to have a high number of false-negatives (type II errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The models may also end up provinding unhelpful insights. For example, the model may identify country of citizenship as a crucial determiner. It won't be helpful to most applicants to tell them to change their citizenship."

    "According to the model, by far the strongest factor leading to application rejection is number of months of training required. Jobs that will require several months of training are not really liked by US immigration. Another strong factor is whether an alternate (i.e. lower) level of education is acceptable for the job, providing the applicant has a certain number of years of experience. The more experience required, the greater the chaces of rejection. Applicants from Thailand also seem to be rejected as relatively high rates.\n",
